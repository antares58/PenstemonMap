# PenstemonMap
Geographic mapping of penstemon species (Penstemon, Keckiella)

I compiled this dataset manually, from the sources listed below, to enable me to create data visualizations of the geographic distribution of penstemon species for my sister, after discovering that the data I wanted did not seem to be available in a downloadable form anywhere. Although the sources all appear to be reliable and based on field science, they disagree on many points of taxonomy, geographic distribution, habitat, and bloom characteristics. I am not a botanist. Where sources disagreed, I attempted to clarify disputed points by studying various internet sources for clues (which sources are most recent? is there a consensus? does any of the conflicting data look like boilerplate or does it look specific to that particular plant? are there photographs that clarify the issue?) but inevitably, some decisions on how to represent the plants in this dataset could be considered arbitrary. Where photographs of species were available, bloom colors in the database were based on the photographic evidence if the text did not agree with the images (e.g., if a source said flowers are red but all verified photographs of that species showed blue to violet flowers, flower color in the dataset is [blue, violet]).

This is a very basic set of data, confined to species reported in the United States, and consisting of a very limited set of characteristics focused on where the plants are found. However, it was designed to be easily extensible in the hopes that anyone who is interested might find it useful.
